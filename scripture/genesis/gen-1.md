<sup>1</sup>In the beggining God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>2</sup>Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

<sup>3</sup>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. <sup>4</sup>God saw that the light was good, and he seperated the light from darkness. <sup>5</sup>God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning; The first day.
